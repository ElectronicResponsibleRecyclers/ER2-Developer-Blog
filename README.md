# Developer Blog Demo

As part of the interview process, we would like to see how you develop in Symfony. We would like you to implement a 
simple blog application. 

## Requirements

- [ ] Allow user's to log in to the application. For this, using `in-memory` users and HTTP Basic Authentication is 
  absolutely fine.
- [ ] Allow administrator users create and edit blog posts
- [ ] Allow blog posts to be displayed publicly
- [ ] Allow authenticated user to leave comments on the blog post
- [ ] Admins and the creator of a comment should be able to edit and remove

## UI Requirements
 - [ ] Make it look pretty (not looking to get too involved in the UI, just a splash of color and some formatting is 
   fine)
 - [ ] Allow user's to submit comments via ajax
 - [ ] Allow users to remove comments via ajax (respecting the above permissions)

### Getting started

1. Build and run the containers.
2. Execute into the PHP container and run `composer install` to install dependencies.
3. Server runs on http://localhost and will load a default "it works!" page when setup correctly

### Submitting completed code

When you have completed the above tasks. Create a zip file of the project, attach it to an email and send it to 
[developers@er2.com](mailto:developers@er2.com). We will reach out for next steps within a week!

### Notes

Our intention is not to have you spend more than 10 hours completing this. If you have any questions or need 
guidance our support team is more than willing to help and can be contacted at [developers@er2.com](mailto:developers@er2.com)
